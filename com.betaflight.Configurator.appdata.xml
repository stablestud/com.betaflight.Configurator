    <p>
      Betaflight Configurator is a crossplatform configuration tool for the Betaflight flight control system.
      It allows you to configure the Betaflight software running on any supported Betaflight target, as well
      as updating the firmware.
      Various types of aircraft are supported by the tool and by Betaflight, e.g. quadcopters, hexacopters, octocopters and fixed-wing aircraft.
    </p>
    <p>
      This configurator is the only configurator with support for Betaflight specific features. It will likely require that you
      run the latest firmware on the flight controller. If you are experiencing any problems please make sure you are running
      the latest firmware version.
